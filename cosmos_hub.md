# The Cosmos Hub

## 1 Introduction
The vision of the Cosmos Network, as laid out in 2016, has been realized.
The creation of a secure software stack for building and connecting applicationspecific
blockchains has catalyzed a thriving ecosystem of sovereign interoperable
communities and an increasingly dynamic inter-blockchain communication
economy. The interchain as originally imagined is taking form. The Cosmos Network
is an association of autonomous communities connected economically and
ideologically with the Cosmos Hub. It is a voluntary association of blockchains
that subscribe to a philosophy of sovereign interoperability, localism, and pluralism.
A network of networks that uphold the right for communities to maintain
technological sovereignty and peacefully interoperate. This philosophy is
grounded in a humility for the extraordinarily rich cultural diversity of human
beings. It is tacit recognition of the fundamental limits of our discretionary
reason in organizing planetary sustainability, while serving as a call to use technology
as best we can to facilitate responsible self-governance. Cosmos offers a
meta-political economy, one that recognizes the need for representation of different
interests at different scales, and for an approach that can bridge the gap
from local to global and back.

The Cosmos Hub’s inaugural role was to originate the internet of blockchains.
It did so by resourcing the development of the Cosmos SDK, IBC, and Tendermint,
the core open-source primitives for the blockchain applications that now
populate the interchain. However, with an active and increasingly sophisticated
IBC network, the needs of the interchain have evolved. Accordingly, the Cosmos
Hub must also transition into a new role: to grow a resilient interchain
economy.
In this new role, the Cosmos Hub becomes a secure platform for others to
build the next generation of interchain-native infrastructure and applications,
opening new opportunities for interchain coordination. From this substrate, the
Cosmos Hub renews its purpose as a provider of infrastructure services whose
utility scales with the growth of the interchain. The Cosmos Hub will secure
and capitalize ecosystem-critical applications, while serving as the port of entry
for new Cosmos participants, and a coordinating center for the infrastructure
and administrative concerns of the interchain.
This paper describes the Cosmos Hub’s layered architecture, beginning with
the collaborative effort required to build and maintain the Cosmos Stack. One
layer above is the Hub’s Interchain Security and Liquid Staking functionality,
which provide a platform for secure economic scaling. And on top of this scaling
platform, a newly proposed layer of Hub-specific functionality: the Interchain
Scheduler and the Interchain Allocator, whose joint purpose is to grow a more
resilient interchain.
- Social Coordination Technology: The Cosmos Hub is a natural place
for Tendermint, Cosmos SDK, and IBC DAOs. A presence on the Cosmos
Hub will open the funding and control of the open-source software to a
wider group of stakeholders.
- Interchain Security: Security is a necessary foundation to build essential
components for the Cosmos Network, and the Cosmos Hub’s Interchain
Security environment will be enriched with new capabilities that
make it more useful, efficient, and cooperative.
- Liquid Staking: Liquidity is critical in the proof of stake economy. The
Cosmos community has studied liquid staking for years and will soon
provide the secure infrastructure for premier vendors to issue liquid staking
assets.
- Interchain Scheduler: The IBC economy is a patchwork of asynchronous
markets, introducing an enormous variety of cross-domain maximum extractable
value (MEV) opportunities. This market can be made more
efficient, more secure, and more lucrative for Cosmos chains and their
users. The interchain needs a secure block space market to avoid off-chain
cartelization and more options for chains seeking to optimize the use of
block space.
- Interchain Allocator: Sustaining the rapid growth of the interchain
will require new approaches to on-chain economic coordination. The Interchain
Allocator is a platform for delegated parties to grow and align
ATOM-based markets, facilitating multi-chain trust and coordination.
The integration of sovereign political economies through transparent collateralized
agreements will unlock higher-order economic power and capital
efficiency.

Figure 1: A simplified representation of the core functionality provided by the Cosmos Hub.
The bottom layer is the Cosmos Stack, funded by the Hub and stewarded by core teams. The
middle layer consists of the upcoming upgrades to scalability of the Hub’s security and liquidity
system. Built on top of Interchain Security and Liquid Staking is Hub-specific functionality,
the proposed Interchain Scheduler and Allocator.

With these primitives, the Cosmos Hub will become a self-propagating economic
engine that drives the expansion and integration of the Cosmos Network. This
‘Cosmos Network’ is an area of economic association with the Cosmos Hub,
primarily via the use of ATOM as the preferred collateral.

The Interchain Scheduler and the Interchain Allocator drive the growth of the
Cosmos Network, together creating a flywheel whereby:
1. Cosmos Hub collects revenues from interchain economic activity by creating
a secure block space market, the Interchain Scheduler, and charging a
matching fee.
2. Revenue is used to drive long term ecosystem alignment and add promising
new projects to the Cosmos Hub’s holdings via the Interchain Allocator.
In turn, these projects expand the Scheduler’s addressable market.

![2](https://github.com/maxlevush-COINSIDE/Joystream-maxlevush/blob/main/cosmos2.png?raw=true)

Figure 2: Core positive feedback loop driving the growth of a resilient interchain. The
Scheduler monetizes IBC economic activity with revenues going to Allocator. The Allocator
supports new Cosmos chains, expanding the addressable market of the Scheduler.

The result is a renewed role for ATOM as preferred collateral within the Cosmos
Network. The Cosmos Hub becomes a long-term holder of ecosystem assets,
drawing valuable projects into Cosmos. ATOM stability, liquidity, and the
overall attractiveness of ATOM denominated collateral increase with a growing
asset backing and deeper ATOM markets. The network effect thus encourages
more participants to join the Cosmos Network and integrate with one another.
Likewise, the public works sponsored by the Cosmos Hub will lead to a healthier
ecosystem and a more demand for the Hub’s infrastructure offerings.
Like a port city at the center of a vast ocean trade network, the Cosmos Hub
will grow to offer increasingly favorable conditions for life and trade within the
Cosmos Network and the interchain at large.

## 2 Securely Scaling Cosmos

The Cosmos Hub is the most secure pillar of the interchain. Interchain Security
enables the reuse of the same validator set and staked collateral to secure
additional state machines. New projects can develop as independent applications
within the Cosmos Hub’s security boundary while the Hub continues to
minimize its security surface. Liquid Staking providers will be the first users of
Interchain Security, enabling ATOM holders to earn staking rewards while also
using their ATOM to pursue other opportunities. Together, Interchain Security
and Liquid Staking create a secure base layer for projects to build and capitalize
valuable interchain utilities.

![3](https://github.com/maxlevush-COINSIDE/Joystream-maxlevush/blob/main/cosmos3.png?raw=true)

Figure 3: Interchain Security empowers independent projects to build on the Cosmos Hub
while Liquid Staking positions ATOM to become the premier interchain reserve asset.

### 2.1 Interchain Security

Interchain Security enables the Cosmos Hub to host a novel category of applications
with complementary functionality. The Cosmos Hub establishes trust by
putting ATOM at risk for consumer chain faults, enabling parallel development
from core teams and collaboration with incentive-aligned consumer chains.4 For
these projects, Interchain Security’s value proposition starts with an increase in
economic security up to the Cosmos Hub’s cost of corruption, together with a
substantial reduction in the marginal cost of security when compared to the
cost of an independent validator set. Interchain Security gives consumer chains
a faster, easier, and cheaper path to market, accelerating innovation within the
service perimeter. Participating projects will be naturally aligned with the Cosmos
Hub community, benefitting from a variety of integrations and collaborative
opportunities with other Cosmos chains.

The development platform afforded by Interchain Security allows the Cosmos
Hub to fulfill several of the functions imagined from inception by allowing third
parties to utilize the Hub’s essential infrastructure to build commercial applications,
for instance:
- Rollup Settlement: A canonical rollup settlement system and scaling
solution in which external data availability providers publish fraud proofs
and resolve fork-choice disputes.
- IBC Routing: A market for IBC relay contracts and multi-hop connections,
aggregating relay providers to create a simple, cost-effective, and
reliable IBC connectivity subscription for a wide coverage area.
- Multiverse: An application deployment utility for projects to permissionlessly
launch consumer chains within a sandboxed environment such as
CosmWasm. Infrastructure automation would make creating a blockchain
secured by the Hub as easy as deploying a smart contract.
- Chain Name Service (CNS): A utility analogous to a root certificate
authority for the interchain. A secure identification and authentication
service for IBC-connected blockchains would provide a single location for
chains to permissionlessly manage information about themselves. By establishing
a secure connection to this resource, clients or on-chain entities
can discover information about other resources within the interchain. A
CNS architecture would likely require components deployed both to the
Cosmos Hub directly as well as a consumer chain.

Interchain Security also allows for several avenues of application development.
Chains may join as independent economic units, diverting a portion of inflation
and fees to cover security costs. Alternatively, core Hub functionality may
be built on a consumer chain and receive financing for infrastructure buildout,
opting for a fee split rather than a dedicated token, or some combination
thereof.

The utility of Interchain Security for consumer chains rests on providing strong
accountability guarantees to a broad set of Cosmos chains and substantiating
the Hub’s credible neutrality.

### 2.2 Liquid Staking

A practical consequence of the current competition between staking and external
uses of capital is that most staking assets are confined to their originating chain,
which hinders cross-chain composability.5 Therefore, full economic integration
of the interchain requires liquid staking. The user experience and capital efficiency
improvement offered by liquid stalking is so substantial that liquid staked
assets are expected to become the dominant transactional medium—particularly
for use-cases exogenous to the originating chain.

Centralized exchanges already provide a form of liquid stake by custodying assets
and staking on behalf of their users. They do so while allowing tokens to
trade freely within the confines of their platform. Moreover, it is possible to create
liquid stake custodially via cryptographic means or via Interchain Accounts.
Since the benefits of liquid staking effectively makes these applications unavoidable,
the Cosmos Hub must ensure that the liquid staking system is as safe
and decentralized as possible by providing for it in-protocol. The current 5%
slashing penalty for equivocation means that ATOM collateral is considerably
under-utilized. The liquid staking module will enable the creation of delegation
shares, and thereby liquid staked assets, which can be used cross-chain with
acceptable risk and user experience tradeoffs. Specifically, delegation shares allow
protocols to accurately price risk while removing the need for unbonding
prior to third party liquid asset issuance. The resulting liquid staking asset can
be easily exported over IBC and accrue rewards while composing with other
protocols to expand the utility of ATOM across the interchain.

Liquid staking requires providers to custody assets, and therefore represents a
significant change to the Cosmos Hub’s security model. The most effective way
to ensure long-term security is to make sure both individual providers and the
marketplace for provision remains decentralized.

A competitive marketplace for liquid staking provision will further improve the
consumer experience, driving protocols to compete on several dimensions, including
trust minimization and safety. This market for cross-chain liquidity will
be the catalyst for ATOM deployment across the interchain, creating new waves
of innovation built on secure Cosmos-native collateral.

## 3 ATOM: The Interchain Reserve Currency

### 3.1 Issuance

Today, the Cosmos Hub’s monetary policy is designed to balance security with
liquidity by targeting of ATOM supply staked. If the staking ratio falls below
this target, issuance increases incrementally until either the staking ratio is
brought back to the target level or the maximum issuance threshold is reached.
Additional staking is incentivized, increasing security at the cost of liquidity.
Conversely, if the staking ratio rises above , issuance incrementally decreases to
ensure the availability of liquid supply. Staking is thus disincentivized, improving
liquidity at the cost of security.

However, keeping of the entire monetary base staked is a substantial capital
inefficiency that limits growth and hinders cross-chain composability. Liquid
staking increases capital efficiency by allowing users to stake ATOM while simultaneously
using the claims on staked ATOM as working capital, thus removing
the competition between staking and other opportunities.

Since liquid staking solves the problem that the current monetary policy was
originally designed to address, issuance can now be reconsidered. Rather than
try to balance security with liquidity, the new monetary policy should balance
interchain adoption, growth, and capitalization with fiscal responsibility while
preserving the security afforded by the original regime.

This new monetary policy has two phases: transition and steady state. The
purpose of the transition phase is twofold. First, to allow consumer chains time
to join Interchain Security, helping to subsidize security expenditure, and second,
to give the community an opportunity to develop the social infrastructure
necessary to effectively manage a sizable treasury. The transition phase starts
the moment that Cosmos shifts to the new monetary policy and ends 36 months
later, at which point the steady state phase begins and lasts indefinitely. During
the transition phase, issuance temporarily increases for the first nine months as
it bootstraps initial funding for a new Cosmos Hub Treasury. Issuance significantly
reduces thereafter. As an additional safety measure, during the transition
phase no more than 10% of the Cosmos Hub Treasury can be deployed within
a 21 day period.

At the beginning of the transition phase 10,000,000 ATOM are issued per month.
This issuance decreases at a declining rate until it reaches steady state issuance
36 months later. Steady state issuance will be 300,000 ATOM per month (a
nod to the speed of light, 300,000 km per second). A portion of the issuance
will be directed to the distribution module as a temporary extension of the
current security subsidy, while the remainder will be directed to the Cosmos
Hub Treasury.

![3.1](https://github.com/maxlevush-COINSIDE/Joystream-maxlevush/blob/main/cosmos3.1.png?raw=true)

Of this monthly issuance, the amount of ATOM issued to validators and delegators
as a security subsidy will start at the same subsidy level as immediately
precedes the transition phase. The subsidy will decrease by 10% every month
for 36 months, at which point it will cease entirely. At this point, the revenue
generated from Interchain Security should meet or exceed the original subsidy.
As a safety measure, if the staking rate ever falls below , the new monetary
policy will pause and the original monetary policy will resume, incrementally
increasing issuance up to a maximum percentage of supply until the staking ratio
again exceeds , at which point issuance will return to a fixed 300,000 ATOM
per month. Note that the security subsidy will also continue to fund the Community
Pool as staking rewards are granted via the distribution module, which
will automatically direct 5% of funds to the Community Pool.

![3.2](https://github.com/maxlevush-COINSIDE/Joystream-maxlevush/blob/main/cosmos3.2.png?raw=true)

The remaining issuance is directed to the new Cosmos Hub Treasury and will
be used to support initiatives that increase adoption, growth, and capitalization
of the interchain, including public works and opportunities for expansion. By
having a well funded treasury, the Cosmos Hub can ensure that capital is not an
obstacle in the pursuit of worthwhile endeavors, enabling more interchain developer
activity and greater liquidity, helping protocols bootstrap their economies
while increasing the Scheduler’s addressable market.

![4](https://github.com/maxlevush-COINSIDE/Joystream-maxlevush/blob/main/cosmos4.png?raw=true)

Figure 4: New issuance from time of activation. Issuance during the transition phase (i.e.
first 36 months) is intended to wean stakers off of their security subsidy and bootstrap the
Cosmos Hub Treasury balance. The Cosmos Hub Treasury is used to capitalize the Allocator.

![5](https://github.com/maxlevush-COINSIDE/Joystream-maxlevush/blob/main/cosmos5.png?raw=true)

Figure 5: Cumulative issuance from time of activation. The proposed new issuance model will
substantially reduce the growth of total ATOM supply over time by shifting from exponential
to linear growth.

### 3.2 Fees

Today, transaction fees paid to the Cosmos Hub are sent to the distribution
module and split among the Community Pool, delegators, and validators. With
the addition of Interchain Security, a portion of transaction fees and issuance
from each consumer chain will be sent to the Cosmos Hub’s distribution module,
paying to secure all chains and replacing the current issuance subsidy.

![6](https://github.com/maxlevush-COINSIDE/Joystream-maxlevush/blob/main/cosmos6.png)

Figure 6: Interchain Security replaces issuance as a means of incentivizing validators and
delegators. If the stake ratio ever drops below , issuance will revert to the original issuance
model until the ratio returns to or higher. Issuance not directed to the distribution module is
directed to the Cosmos Hub Treasury, a new capital pool managed by domain-specific councils
to fund public goods and grow a resilient interchain.

The anticipated global fee module will add a whitelist of accepted tokens with
corresponding fee minimums that will be maintained by Cosmos Hub governance.
While serviceable in the short-term, governance-determined pricing for
every accepted token is cumbersome and prone to resource mispricing, particularly
as the whitelist grows. Instead, governance should set a single ATOM floor
fee, while the base fee is algorithmically priced in response to demand. Exchange
rates obtained from trust-minimized oracles may then be used to automatically
update the corresponding price for all remaining whitelisted tokens. The Cosmos Hub governance may then elect to use infrastructure provided by the Allocator
in order to periodically auction collected fees into a target currency, ATOM, or
stablecoins before tokens are sent to the distribution module.

All other applications may create their own fee mechanisms with the assumption
of transaction inclusion. For instance, the Allocator and Scheduler can
customize their fee structure depending on their chosen architecture, with returns
flowing to the Cosmos Hub Treasury.

## 4 The Cosmos Economic Engine

With a secure domain for adding new functionality, beginning with cross-chain
liquidity, the Cosmos Hub now has the necessary components to assume its
role as platform for the creation of valuable utilities, a hub for the interchain.
In order to realize its purpose, to drive the expansion of a more secure and
efficient IBC economy and building long-term alignment with a growing Cosmos
Network, the Cosmos Hub will require two mutually-reinforcing systems:
1. Interchain Scheduler: a secure cross-chain block space marketplace and
MEV solution
2. Interchain Allocator: a venue for economic coordination and interchain
project alignment

### 4.1 Interchain Scheduler: A Secure Blockspace Marketplace

While Interchain Security provides a secure platform for building a coalition
of Cosmos-aligned applications, the Interchain Scheduler builds on top of this
platform to offer defensible utility that scales with the growth of the wider IBC
economy. This is achieved with a marketplace for tokenized cross-chain block
space.

MEV relay networks enable off-chain markets for private transaction submission.
Such systems are attractive because they allow more expressive and efficient
execution of user intent with capabilities like front-running protection,
multi-transaction bundling, failed transaction prevention, and transaction sequence
priority. As MEV opportunities grow, such relay systems are becoming
increasingly active within the interchain. And by offering MEV relay service
on multiple chains, relays are able to further articulate cross-chain execution
guarantees.

The assurances of an MEV relay network are only as strong as the number of
validators running modified software. While attractive for individual users, this model presents systemic centralizing concerns if left unchecked. Functionality
rests on trusted relationships among validators, MEV relays, and builders, even
extending to intermediation of the node software run by validators. Therefore,
these networks are possible vectors for off-chain cartelization with little counterforce
to ensure accountability as they scale. At worst, the monopolizing tendency
of off-chain block space markets could undermine efficient transaction fee
pricing and, ultimately, chain security.

Beyond centralization concerns, the revenues generated from MEV networks are
typically shared among validators or clients directing orderflow, while protocols
and their token holders are left out of the value chain. To ensure fairness and
efficiency for chains and users alike, the interchain ecosystem requires a competitive
market with differentiated MEV solutions. The Interchain Scheduler
addresses these concerns by bringing MEV markets on-chain, thereby minimizing
trust, improving quality of service, and enabling direct block space regulation
by chains themselves. Moreover, an on-chain market can provide a more fair
and transparent system for returning revenues to their originating protocols and
token holders.

Using the capabilities enabled by Tendermint’s latest ABCI++ upgrade, transaction
inclusion and ordering can be segregated and the rights to order transactions
for a designated block in the future can be tokenized, traded, and transported
over IBC.

The Scheduler system works as follows:
1. When the consumer chain enables the Scheduler module, it can enter
into a cross-chain contract to provide a portion of their block space (e.g.,
one block every minute). Chains may sell as much blockspace in the
marketplace as they wish, above some minimal threshold.
2. Once the agreement is in place, the Scheduler issues non-fungible token
reservations representing each future block region on the consumer chain.
Reservation tokens from all participating chains are then periodically auctioned
in batches.
3. Optionally, tokenized reservations may be traded on a secondary market.
This is possible until the reservation is redeemed to the appropriate validator
on the partner chain, along with the desired transaction sequence.
4. Upon successful block execution, a split of proceeds from the Scheduler
auction are sent back to the partner chain.
By purchasing synchronous regions of block space on different chains, users can
lock-in arbitrage opportunities or schedule cross-chain settlement transactions
with strong execution guarantees.

![7](https://github.com/maxlevush-COINSIDE/Joystream-maxlevush/blob/main/cosmos7.png)

Figure 7: Depiction of a scheduled sequence of transactions occurring over multiple chains
in successive blocks. The Scheduler leverages ABCI++ to enable partner chains to tokenize
reservations for future block space. Those reservations are auctioned in a common MEV marketplace,
enabling stronger atomicity and settlement guarantees than off-chain counterparts.

In moving the interchain MEV market on-chain, the Scheduler can offer a trustminimized
assurance that users hold an exclusive right to order transactions for
future block regions. Moreover, a common market for multi-chain block space
will command higher rates by securing cross-chain atomicity, while establishing
defensible network effects. This novel market structure is intended to complement
the off-chain MEV economy, providing different trade-offs and increasing
competition to the benefit of chain security.

![8](https://github.com/maxlevush-COINSIDE/Joystream-maxlevush/blob/main/cosmos8.png)

Figure 8: The Scheduler creates an in-protocol market for interchain block space, allowing
chains to specify allowable MEV. Unlike other solutions that only split revenues with validators,
the Scheduler also splits revenues with consumer chains.

A portion of block space may also be designated for use by other chains within
the Scheduler network, analogous to a free trade agreement where the goods
and services of neighboring economies are given preference. The Scheduler system
will provide a substrate for service providers to create a variety of MEVnative
applications: settlement layers with cross-chain time preference, IBC
relay aggregators and routing utilities, on-demand liquidity networks, or trustminimized
best execution services.

The Scheduler will be available first to Interchain Security consumer chains for
a secure initial deployment. The intention is to expand to become the primary
venue for future interchain block space. The cross-chain MEV revenues generated
from the Interchain Scheduler will flow back to the Cosmos Hub Treasury
to drive growth by capitalizing public works and the Interchain Allocator.

### 4.2 Interchain Allocator: Economic Coordination and Long Term Alignment

To date, ATOM has funded the development of foundational software components
powering a thriving ecosystem. ATOM’s liquidity, availability on exchanges,
and its engaged user base has made it the primary entrypoint for those
looking to experiment with new Cosmos applications.

However, until liquid staking is introduced, interchain growth is hindered by
the conflict between the native staking system and other opportunities for utilizing
ATOM. Liquid staked assets eliminate the opportunity cost of staking,
prompting growth. However, to further support ecosystem growth and economic
alignment, the Cosmos Hub could also offer functionality for external protocols
and communities to develop strategies for economic coordination between staked
ATOMs and new projects in the interchain, aligning the utility of ATOM with
ecosystem growth.

The function of the Interchain Allocator is to provide new Cosmos projects
a more efficient path to user acquisition, liquidity, and long-term ecosystem
alignment.

![9](https://github.com/maxlevush-COINSIDE/Joystream-maxlevush/blob/main/cosmos9.png)

Figure 9: The Interchain Allocator is a system for capital allocation and incentive alignment.
The more Coin X that the Cosmos Hub holds and the more ATOM that Chain X holds, the
more incentive aligned the two chains become.

The Allocator provides two basic tools that enable incentive-aligned communities
to develop strategies for economic coordination on behalf of the Cosmos
Hub:
1. Covenant: a system for establishing multilateral agreements with designated
chains and IBC-enabled entities.
2. Rebalancer: a system for automatically managing asset portfolios with
public liquidity.

The Cosmos Hub community will actively seek to fund incentive-aligned communities
that can credibly aid in achieving the Allocator’s mandate, which includes
the following:
- Increasing the velocity of new Cosmos project creation
- Accelerating project growth and sustainability
- Expanding the economy for cross-chain blockspace
- Aligning incentives between new projects and the Cosmos Hub
- Making ATOM the most desirable, widely deployed reserve asset in the
interchain

The Cosmos Hub would seek to fund incentive-aligned DAOs to carry out the
Allocator’s mandate as successful execution will require human judgment. For
example, to create an incentive-aligned DAO from which the Cosmos Hub may
source judgment, ATOM stakers could “bond” their liquid stake to a new
DAO instance for a specified duration. More ATOM bonded with a longer
lockup results in greater voting power within the DAO, where V otingPower =
AtomAmount ∗ RemainingBondDuration. The Cosmos Hub may grant this
DAO a recurring funding rate and a performance-dependent bonus, which is
paid to DAO participants in exchange for their service and for putting their
capital at risk. This new DAO could then utilize the Covenant and Rebalancer
to achieve the Allocator’s mandate.

Covenant

Without the Covenant system, protocol-to-protocol coordination is cumbersome,
requiring multiple governance proposals to conduct the simplest interprotocol
arrangement (e.g., establish an interchain account, send tokens, enter
a liquidity pool). The Covenant system streamlines this process by creating a
vehicle that can implement inter-protocol transactions with as little as a single
action by each protocol. To use it, one protocol sets parameters and deposits
the funds into a covenant. If the other protocol has any issues with the original
parameters, they may establish and fund a new covenant with updated parameters.
This process repeats until a covenant is fully funded, at which point the
deal terms are active.

While the Covenant system itself is a simple primitive, other protocols can
use this system to build increasingly sophisticated multilateral agreements to
improve inter-protocol coordination, liquidity provisioning, and incentive alignment.

![10](https://github.com/maxlevush-COINSIDE/Joystream-maxlevush/blob/main/cosmos10.png)

Figure 10: The Hub’s Allocation DAO uses the Covenant system to enter into on-chain
agreements with other chains. In time, the Hub may support multiple Allocation DAOs.
Other chains may form their own Allocation DAOs, which would further streamline crossprotocol
coordination.

Rebalancer

The Rebalancer system is a tool for the execution of third-party capital allocation
strategies for liquid assets that takes the current portfolio, a target
portfolio, and exchange policy as inputs. The Rebalancer periodically computes
assets to be sold or acquired to incrementally move toward the target
portfolio. The assets are sold or acquired according to the user’s desired policy,
which could include gradual dutch auction or direct trade on a whitelisted
exchange.10 Users of the Rebalancer can set parameters to strike the desired
balance between urgency and slippage minimization on a portfolio or per-asset
basis.

Interchain Allocation

Together, these tools can be used to create collateralized agreements with other
decentralized entities, deploying and rebalancing capital. Examples of how protocols
may use the Allocator include:
- Mutual stakeholding and protocol-to-protocol collaboration
- Providing guarantees on auction price floors
- Expanding liquid staked ATOM markets by entering into AMM pools
with liquid staked ATOM or ATOM-backed assets such as collateralized
stablecoins
- Rebalancing reserves and tuning the monetary properties of ATOM with
diversified collateral backing in order to make ATOM a more desirable
collateral asset
- Participating in other chain’s governance as a delegate of the Cosmos Hub
by voting as a block on proposals from tokens held by the DAO or third
parties

The Allocator is a response to market demand. Protocols already seek alignment
with ATOM, the Cosmos Network, and core software development initiatives.
The Allocator gives such projects a more streamlined, formal, and quantifiable
means of collaboration.

Cosmos is uniquely positioned to support emerging IBC-enabled applications in
building utility and increasing interchain liquidity. Increasing interchain liquidity
is a win-win for both Hub-aligned protocols and the Hub itself because it
strengthens the economic development of the Hub-aligned protocol, while simultaneously
increasing the utility of the Interchain Scheduler. Greater liquidity
increases the utility of the Interchain Scheduler because it increases the market
for arbitrage, making blockspace more valuable, thereby increasing the amount
an MEV captor could pay for Scheduler-provided blockspace while remaining
profitable.

The positive feedback loop between the Scheduler benefiting from increased interchain
liquidity and the Allocator deploying capital to increase interchain liquidity
gives the Hub asymmetric advantages relative to other liquidity providers.
That is, the Scheduler and Allocator combined enable the Hub to benefit from
providing liquidity, which reduces the Hub’s overall risk and enables the Hub to
provide more capital.

Lastly, in addition to the network having the largest and most sophisticated
validator set, Cosmos can also use capital allocation as an added incentive for
chains to choose the Cosmos Hub as their Interchain Security provider and
further integrate with the Cosmos Network as it matures.

In addition to these immediate next steps for the Cosmos Hub, the Allocator
opens numerous opportunities for expanding the greater Cosmos Network:
1. Multiple Allocator DAOs: The Allocator would be designed to allow
for more than one Allocator DAO. The Cosmos community will likely fund
Allocator DAOs with differentiated theses and access so as to improve
Cosmos Hub treasury diversity and performance.
2. Liquidity-as-a-Service: an incentive-aligned community could deploy
ATOM into a covenant and automatically use that ATOM to create liquidity
provider tokens when a counterparty matches the ATOM with a
given amount of a different token (e.g.,100 ATOM matched with 5,000
IST to create ATOM-IST LP tokens).
3. Under-Collateralized Financing: Prior to Interchain Security, there
was no on-chain way for a lender to recoup capital in an under-collateralized
loan if the borrower defaults. With Interchain Security, a capitalized entity
could provide loans to consumer chains without the borrowing protocol
putting down any collateral upfront. If the borrowing protocol defaults on
its loan, they could mint the borrowing protocol’s tokens to cover losses.
4. Liquidity Saving: Covenants can be used to direct capital into trade
networks, improving liquidity profiles and reducing the occurrence of insolvency
due to stressors. Such injections can be optimized for network
level properties to improve the overall health of the network.
5. Allocation Beyond the Cosmos Hub: Protocols may use the Allocator’s
Covenant and Rebalancer tools without the Cosmos Hub as a
counterparty. Any usage of the Allocator is beneficial to the Cosmos Hub,
even when the Cosmos Hub is not a counterparty, because it facilitates
future integration into the Cosmos Network.

The Interchain Allocator is designed to increase the rate of Cosmos-aligned
project growth and expand the cross-chain blockspace economy. Accordingly,
the Allocator fosters cross-protocol coordination while installing ATOM as the
primary reserve asset of the interchain. The Cosmos Network’s expanding
sphere of ATOM-based collateral establishes a region of cooperative integration,
benefiting all those who contribute to its success. In providing a generalized
multi-party collateralization system, the Interchain Allocator forms the
basis for a more collaborative interchain economy, empowering creative endeavors
that leverage the primitive to engender trust and effect the next phase of
interchain growth.

## 5 Cosmos Governance: A Forum for Sovereign

Interoperability

The Cosmos design pattern is one of composable modules and standardized messaging
that gives rise to emergent structure. This philosophy runs through the
social infrastructure of the Cosmos as much as its technical components. The
software development process is highly decentralized with no one Cosmos development
team. Rather, development is accomplished via an intricate network
of open source projects and contributors.11 However, to achieve the ambitions
of this next phase of interchain cooperation, Cosmos will require a shared organizational
language and a substrate for decentralized planning, resourcing, and
accountability.

### 5.1 The Cosmos Governance Stack

The Cosmos SDK has a history of pioneering governance innovations, such as
an advanced delegation system; governance-activated node upgrades; and a generalized
message passing system that allows any account, whether individual,
group, smart contract, or chain, to execute arbitrary transactions, locally or
over IBC.

However, the Cosmos Hub’s ambitious technical roadmap and commitment to
building an autonomous, self-sustaining political economy requires pushing these
technologies even further, extending governance capabilities to suit Cosmos’
needs and creating more robust social layers that tie together a constellation of
participating entities, core teams, funding organizations, and other DAOs that
wish to make the Hub their home.

Without advance knowledge of the precise social architecture that will emerge
in this next phase of Cosmos development, the Cosmos Hub should furnish a
generalized system that may be used by any Hub-aligned DAO to flexibly deploy
governance infrastructure that meets their needs.

The Governance Stack would provide a general specification for DAOs to selfdescribe
their organizational structure and relationships with one another. The
Cosmos Governance Stack gives entities a shared vocabulary for expressing governance
forms with adaptive on-chain and off-chain layers. The modular organizational
infrastructure could be adapted to meet a particular group’s needs,
while offering transparency into their operations facilitating accountability and
alignment. The following example illustrates what such a system might look
like for three different entities.

Figure 11: Given the complexity of the ideas proposed in this paper, creating a flexible system
to deploy new DAOs, help them coordinate with one another, and hold them accountable
would increase the likelihood of successful implementation. The proposed governance stack
combines new and existing components (e.g., Gov, Groups, Authz, and Interchain Accounts)
to create a language shared by DAOs operating on the Hub. New features include systems
for recurring payments, planning, and reporting. The diagram above compares three different
DAO patterns. Note that the inputs above are for demonstrative purposes only and are not
suggestive of a specific proposal.

Most of the requisite technology is available today—Groups, Authz, and Interchain
Accounts—though they are rarely represented as an integrated system
for creating organizational assemblages that interact on-chain. The parameters
above are put forward for community consideration with the intention of
arriving at a standard for establishing Hub-based DAOs that can effectively
coordinate and govern shared resources.

### 5.2 The Cosmos Assembly

With a more articulated way to establish new entities, a wide range of organizational
structures can establish themselves on the Cosmos Hub. Core teams can
establish a presence, as could representatives from across the ecosystem, including
infrastructure providers, community organizations, and other chains.

To access Cosmos Hub resources, these entities would participate in a common
system for planning and coordination of public goods and growth-oriented endeavors.
This system must remain flexible enough to dynamically provision
resources and authorities while remaining accountable to the Cosmos Hub and
the interchain with appropriate checks and balances.

The Cosmos Hub Assembly, a proposed decentralized organizational body, could
represent the strategic interests of the Cosmos Hub community. The Cosmos
Hub Assembly, together with a set of domain-specific Councils, form a governance
supply chain that enables a variety of entities to work within a common
framework.

Figure 12: Proposed Cosmos Hub governance structure. DAOs may apply to become a
council if they wish to access Cosmos Hub Treasury resources or become accountable for
delegated Cosmos Hub roles and capabilities. All councils together form the Cosmos Assembly,
which does yearly budgeting and goal-setting. The Assembly is accountable to ATOM holders,
who have ultimate veto.

Today, the Cosmos Stack and the Cosmos Hub are built by a variety of organizations
that contribute to product-specific working groups. Most recently, the
Consensus Council was created to formalize one such multi-stakeholder relationship.
Likewise, temporary initiatives, such as proposal 72 to onboard consumer
chains to Interchain Security, are typically mediated by multi-signature committees.
The Councils and Assembly system are intended to make existing informal and
off-chain workflows more explicit, accountable, and open to wider participation.
14 Improvements to the Cosmos Hub Forum over the last year, as well as
new on-chain functionality like generic Gov proposals and the Groups module
improve the Cosmos community’s capacity to coordinate. Likewise, adoption
of Authz and upcoming features such as optimistic voting, allowing designated
third parties to defensively revoke capabilities and block actions, will increase
operational efficiency through constrained delegation.

ATOM holders have the responsibility of defining and updating the Cosmos
Hub Charter, which includes directives at the highest level: the purpose of the
Cosmos Hub, its essential governance architecture, as well as which entities are
admitted Councils. Furthermore, ATOM holders have ultimate discretion over
the passage of policies, priorities, and budgets with veto power on all proposals
put forward by the Cosmos Assembly.

For a DAO to become a council, it must put up a proposal for discussion on the
Cosmos Hub forum that includes the items required by the Governance Stack.
It must then convince ATOM governance to pass the proposal. If successful, the
council will be added to the Charter, resourced, and accorded the appropriate
authorities.

The Cosmos Assembly is composed of delegates from each of the respective councils.
The number of seats for any given council represents the weight of that
council within the Cosmos Assembly. On a yearly basis, the Cosmos Assembly
will set priorities, perform a participatory budgeting process, and draft a proposal
that will be proposed optimistically, subject to ATOM holder veto.

Public accountability is perhaps the most significant challenge of decentralized
governance. The introduction of a new Community Council can aid in this effort.
The Cosmos Community Council will represent the interests of the ATOM
Community within the Cosmos Assembly and on a day-to-day basis. Their role
will include observing the work of core teams, providing feedback on product
decisions, and providing a bridge to the wider community by communicating
important facets of ongoing workstreams. The precise role of the Community
Council and specifics about its formation should be discussed on the Cosmos
Hub Forum in conjunction with the initial formation of the Cosmos Hub Charter.

The Cosmos Governance Stack and the subsequent formation of a Cosmos Assembly
permit the higher-order organization required for the next phase of Cosmos’s
development. Though Cosmos Hub governance is in some ways the most
mature in the ecosystem, it will need to evolve significantly to meet the needs
of a growing political economy. The first step in this process should be a community
dialogue on the forum about a Cosmos Hub Charter and initial Rules
of Engagement. Some of the issues that will need close attention include balance
of power among committees representing various stakeholders, term limits,
mitigating conflict of interest, and provisions about membership within multiple
organizational bodies. Community-driven creation of initial governing documents
will be complex, but effective governance is only created through a shared
commitment to accountability and decentralization of power.

## 6 Conclusion

The Cosmos Hub gave rise to the internet of blockchains. Interchain Security
and Liquid Staking are the final building blocks required for a secure interchain
economy, which in turn, enable the creation of the Hub’s application-specific
functionality, the Interchain Allocator and Interchain Scheduler.

Together, the Allocator and Scheduler would create a flywheel that builds additional
utility: the Allocator capitalizes new Cosmos chains and incentivizes
them to transact while the Scheduler creates a market for high-value IBC transactions
and uses revenue to support network growth. With the creation of this
powerful economic bloc, the Cosmos Hub’s success becomes coupled to the success
of other Cosmos chains and that of the wider IBC economy. Infrastructure
and community come together to drive the expansion of the interchain with
credibly neutral functionality, capital, and social infrastructure.

Today, the Cosmos Stack is the leading framework for building sovereign interoperable
blockchains. With the introduction of the Scheduler and Allocator systems,
the Cosmos Hub will become the leading platform for scaling IBC-enabled
applications, securing foundational infrastructure for the interchain and accelerating
economic coordination for the next chapter of interchain growth.
